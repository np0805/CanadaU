## Project Overview

CanadaU is a website which gathers trends from Canadian university subreddits, and puts them all in one place.

Technologies we'll be using:
- Python with the [Flask](https://palletsprojects.com/p/flask/) framework
- JavaScript with the [React](https://reactjs.org) framework
- [Reddit API](https://www.reddit.com/dev/api/)
